<h1>Health Recommendation System Using Parallel Processing and Distributed File Systems</h1>
A Recommendation System which uses machine learning model classifier to predict patients with high susceptibility index ( a measure indicating the susceptibility of a patient to a heart attack )using features like Chest Pain, Cholesterol, Blood Pressure etc.
Since the dataset was very large, it was stored on a distributed file system using HDFS and parallel processing was done using Apache Spark to reduce processing time.
Logistic Regression Machine Learning Model was used to perform the predictions.
